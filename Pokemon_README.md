Welcome to the World of Pokémon!

There are a few steps that you need to complete before you are able
to enter this magical world. First, you need to download or clone this
repository. The next step is to type and enter "bundle install" into your
terminal. This will download the necessary gems that you will need in order
to interact with the game and see all of its awesome features.
After completing these two steps, all you need to do is simply enter
"ruby bin/run.rb" in your terminal.

The rest of the game is pretty self explanatory. Simply use your keyboard
and number pad to create your trainer. After creating a trainer, you will use
your number pad in order to select your starter Pokémon. After choosing
which Pokémon you want to roll with, the rest of the journey is up to you!

As a trainer, you can enter a game in which you try to catch a wild Pokémon.
But be careful, you must choose the correct number or that Pokémon may escape,
never to be seen again. There is a chance you will get another attempt, but
better to guess correctly the first time!

From there you can check your current Pokémon roster, release any Pokémon
that you feel aren't living up to expectations, or even see a list of all
Pokémon and their attributes. If you really want to dig deep, you could also
search for Pokémon by their types (i.e. "grass", "water", etc).

You can exit the game anytime, but don't worry, your data will be saved. If
you want to log on, simply type in your trainer name and age, and you will
still have the Pokémon on your roster that you caught last time. Have fun!
